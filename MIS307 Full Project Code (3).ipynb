    "## 1. Project Description\n",
    "A local coffee shop is rapidly growing and is in need of a new Point-of-Sale (POS) system. This system needs to provide employees with a user interface that will allow them to track sales, host a loyalty program, and generate weekly and monthly sales reports. The employee’s need to be able to create a sale, attach a loyalty program number, modify the sale, and complete the sale. In addition, they must be able to add users to the loyalty program and check customers’ current  loyalty status. They have requested this information to be stored in a database. This will allow for simple data submission and recovery. The coffee shop’s manager has requested the ability to generate a weekly and monthly report containing information such as the customers who visited most frequently, most popular items sold, and average purchase size and amount in USD. This information will be used to analyze the performance of the business based on customer trends and behaviors. \n",

    "The functionality of this project is to simulate a small coffee shop point-of-sale (POS) system that creates a new sale, has a loyalty member option, and has managerial insights to track trends throughout the months. Our sales creation consists of our menu on the user interface (UI) where the employee will choose what the customer tells them. At the end of the sale, they can close the sale and it will show the total price to communicate to the customer. From there, the data from the sale gets imported into our sales receipts csv file which is connected to our database. A customer can also use their loyalty account to gain points and receive a certain percentage discount after 10 points (currently set to 5%). The system can look up the customer in the system to see if they have a loyalty account and how many points they are at. If they would like to sign up for an account, the employee can grab their information and put it into the UI which will then import that data into our customer csv file which is connected to the database. Lastly, we have managerial insights that are generated using SQL to view frequently visiting customers, most popular items, and purchase behavior for the month. The overall impact of this POS system is to give the employees a more friendly UI to work with and a more structured system to view analytics based on products and customers.\n"

    "Overall the project was a valuable learning experience for everyone in the group. We all liked meeting up to figure out how to do the project and which roles each of us would take. In the group, we were able to find our roles and responsibilities pretty early on because two people in the group were well experienced in coding, while the other two were still able to code, but aided as help and provided insight for each part of the project. Without all of us working together it would have been much harder to finish the project and get it to run. We achieved all of our goals because they were based on the rubric and fulfilled all requirements. For possible improvements, if we had more time, we would have liked to condense some of the code to make it more efficient. We were also interested in adding additional features, such as converting customer_ids and product_ids into their name values as part of the managerial insight graphics, but time restrictions did not allow."
